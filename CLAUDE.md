# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start Vite development server (localhost:5173)
npm run build    # Create production build
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
```

## Architecture Overview

**Stock Report Puncher** is a React-TypeScript application that processes financial PDF documents through a multi-stage pipeline: **LlamaParse → Gemini AI → Google Sheets**. The app follows a service-oriented architecture with centralized state management.

### Core Processing Pipeline

1. **PDF Ingestion**: Users select PDFs from Google Drive INPUT folders or upload directly
2. **LlamaParse Stage**: Batch processing (up to 10 files) converts PDFs to structured JSON
3. **Gemini Processing**: AI extracts financial data with context awareness (CREATE vs UPDATE mode)
4. **Google Sheets Export**: Structured financial data is written to organized spreadsheets

### Service Layer Architecture

**Google Service** (`services/googleService.ts`)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication and session management
- Google Drive operations (folder creation, file listing, downloads)
- Google Sheets operations (batch updates, cell management)
- Comprehensive error parsing for Google API responses

**LlamaParse Service** (`services/llamaParseService.ts`)
- Batch PDF processing with real-time progress tracking
- Async job polling with configurable timeouts
- Individual file error handling with partial success support

**Gemini Service** (`services/geminiService.ts`) 
- Two processing modes: CREATE (new datasets) and UPDATE (add columns to existing data)
- Context-aware processing using existing sheet data
- Schema-validated JSON output with financial data structures
- Legacy PDF processing and new LlamaParse integration

**Storage Service** (`services/storageService.ts`)
- Session-based intermediate data storage between parsing stages
- Document metadata tracking with confidence scoring
- LocalStorage persistence with Google Drive integration hooks

### Configuration Requirements

Required environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
# Google Cloud Console credentials
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=          # API key with Drive/Sheets/Gemini access
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=        # OAuth 2.0 client ID
VITE_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=  # Root folder for stock data organization

# LlamaParse integration  
VITE_LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY=      # LlamaIndex Cloud API key (starts with llx-)

# Optional performance tuning
VITE_LLAMAPARSE_BATCH_SIZE=10    # Default batch size for PDF processing
VITE_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT=300000   # 5 minute timeout for operations
```

See `GOOGLE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed Google Cloud Console setup including API enablement and OAuth configuration.

### State Management Pattern

**Centralized State**: App.tsx manages all application state using React hooks with view-based routing through AppView enum.

**Key State Flow**:
- `view` controls which component renders (AUTHENTICATING → SELECTION_MENU → PROCESSING → SUCCESS)
- `currentProcessingStage` tracks pipeline progress ('llamaparse' | 'gemini' | 'saving')
- `llamaParseResults` stores intermediate JSON data between processing stages
- Processing progress flows through real-time updates via callback functions

### Google Drive Folder Structure

```
Main Drive Folder/
├── INPUT/
│   ├── {STOCK}/              # PDFs to process
│   └── {STOCK}/
├── OUTPUT/                   # Generated by app
│   ├── {STOCK}/              # Processed results  
│   └── {STOCK}/
└── Individual Stock Folders/ # User-created via app
    ├── {TICKER}/
    │   └── Financials        # Google Sheet with extracted data
    └── {TICKER}/
```

### Component Architecture

**Processing Flow Components**:
- `SelectionMenu`: Three-path entry (New Upload/Update Existing/Process from Drive)
- `ProcessingProgress`: Multi-stage visualization with file-by-file tracking
- `LlamaParseReview`: Intermediate review of parsed JSON data
- `DataTable`: Results display with Google Sheets integration and save functionality

**Data Handling**:
- Components receive data through props from centralized App state
- Service calls are made through App component methods
- Error states are handled consistently across all views

### Financial Data Processing Logic

**CREATE Mode**: Build comprehensive financial dataset from scratch
- Extracts ALL line items from financial statements (Income/Balance/Cash Flow)
- Creates standardized "superset" of unique line items with normalized terminology
- Arranges periods chronologically (earliest to latest)
- Performs internal verification (Balance Sheet equation, Cash Flow reconciliation)

**UPDATE Mode**: Add new time periods to existing sheet structure  
- Only extracts data for line items already present in sheet
- Focuses on finding NEW time periods as additional columns
- Matches existing naming conventions and units exactly
- Maintains data consistency with current sheet structure

### Error Handling Strategy

**Layered Error Management**:
- Service-level: Detailed Google API error parsing and recovery
- Processing-level: Partial success handling (some files can fail while others succeed)
- UI-level: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- Storage-level: Session state tracking for recovery scenarios

**Key Debugging Points**:
- All services include comprehensive console logging
- Processing statistics track files/line items/periods found
- LlamaParse progress includes per-file status tracking
- localStorage preserves processed file history to prevent reprocessing

### TypeScript Interfaces

**Core Data Types**:
- `FinancialDataItem`: Individual extracted financial data points
- `ParsedFinancialDocument`: Structured storage for parsed documents with metadata
- `BatchProcessingProgress`: Real-time progress tracking for batch operations
- `LlamaParseResult`: Individual file processing results with status/confidence

### Integration Points

**Google APIs**: Requires enabled Drive API, Sheets API, and Gemini API with proper OAuth scope configuration.

**LlamaParse**: Batch processing with configurable limits and timeout handling.

**Storage System**: Designed for future Google Drive persistence expansion beyond current localStorage implementation.
